# React hooks
A collection of hooks I've come across and/or implemented in my own projects. Feel free to add your own!

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your system. 

## Installation

```javascript
npm install
npm run storybook
```

Storybook will typically start at http://localhost:6006/.

## Using Storybook
Storybook allows you to browse, interact with, and develop your React components in isolation.

- Component Navigation:
  - Use the sidebar to navigate between your different components.
- Component View:
  - The main panel displays the currently selected component.
- Component Variations (Stories):
  - Many components will have multiple stories showcasing different variations, states, or usage examples.
